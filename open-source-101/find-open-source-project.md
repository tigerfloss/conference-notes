##Q&A

#### Other opportunities beside coding?
> There's tech writing; documentation; translation; so much of the OS community is in english we need to contribute to getting everyone in

> Testing; bug

> Marketing

> Graphic design; UX/UI

#### Legal ramifications of contributions (Can lawyers contribute?)
> Open Source license, has foundation with copyright law

> Contributor license agreement

> As a new contributor (unless you're a lawyer), you will be the least concerned about copyright law

> Without LICENSE open source will not exist

> Proprietary software has LICENSE too

#### Working for a company and contributing to Open Source, how do you handle that?
> You have to look at your agreement

> You have to talk with your company if it's `okay` 

#### How can you get over the mental hurdle of overwriting somebody else's stuff? (Imposter Syndrome)
> If you feel uncomfortable changing something; You probably have to have a conversation first
