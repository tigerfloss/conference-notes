## Conference Notes

This repository started on April 16, a day before **OpenSource 101** in Columbia,SC

I decided that I will start taking notes of the conferences that I go to an commit these notes to GitHub.

Most of the note might have some typos and md errors. These notes are typed in a hurry to keep up with the keynotes
